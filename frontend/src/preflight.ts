// The one environment check this client makes, and it is a refusal rather than a
// branch.
//
// Two things below the login are not optional and neither can be supplied by the
// page itself. A **secure context**, because that is what `navigator.clipboard`,
// `navigator.keyboard` and WebCodecs are all gated on. And the **WebCodecs video
// decoder**, because every target may deliver its desktop as an encoded video stream
// (even though an RDP graphics pipeline can be composed instead). Sound is optional:
// a browser without `AudioDecoder` runs the desktop without it, and the existing
// audio error path closes that socket when a stream is offered.
//
// So the checks happen once, before React mounts, and the answer is no only where
// the desktop itself cannot run. Nothing downstream tests `isSecureContext` or
// `typeof VideoDecoder` again, and nothing carries a second picture path for either
// case: there is no such session left to have a path for.
//
// The gateway speaks plain HTTP and always has — it has no TLS listener and is not
// getting one. A secure context therefore comes from where the page is reached, not
// from what the gateway is:
//
//   http://localhost:52380, http://127.0.0.1:52380, http://[::1]:52380   loopback
//   http://<label>.localhost:52380                                       RFC 6761
//   https://gateway.example                                    TLS-terminating proxy
//
// A LAN address on plain http is the case this refuses, and the message names the
// three ways out.
